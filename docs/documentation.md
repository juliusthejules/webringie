## Getting Started
Getting started with Webringie is simple! Just follow these steps to add your site.

### Adding Your Site to Webringie

**Step 1: Set Up Your API**

Create a `metadata.json` file that includes the necessary metadata for your site. Here's a sample structure:

```json
[
    {
        "website": "https://yourwebsite.com",
        "title": "Your Website Title",
        "description": "A brief description of your website.",
        "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
        "backlink": "https://yourwebsite.com/backlink"
    }
]
```

**Step 2: Add the Script Tag**

Add the following `<script>` tag to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://juliusthejules.github.io/webringie/js/webringie.js" defer></script>
```

This will automatically connect your site to the Webringie API and enable the sharing of your metadata.

**Step 3: Configuration (if necessary)**
