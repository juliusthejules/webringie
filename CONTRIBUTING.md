## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the main project.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name for your branch to indicate the purpose of your changes. For example, if you're fixing a bug, you might name your branch `fix-bug-description`.

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   Make your changes in your new branch. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, ensure that your code is well-commented and follows the project's coding standards.

4. **Test Your Changes**  
   Before submitting your changes, ensure they work as intended. Thoroughly test any new features or bug fixes to avoid introducing new issues.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request (PR) against the main branch. In your PR description, provide a clear explanation of what you changed and why. If applicable, reference any related issues.
